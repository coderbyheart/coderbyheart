As a [Software Crafter](https://www.softwarecrafters.org/) I am using my 20+ years of experience working as a software developer, consultant, coach, mentor, and founder to build cloud-based solutions for the Internet of Things using JavaScript at [Nordic Semiconductor](https://www.nordicsemi.com/).

My professional career has been greatly influenced by taking an active role in communities, whether as a participant, contributor, [initiator](#communities), or [speaker](#talks).

I especially enjoys the diverse and deep discussion of the [Software Craft Community](https://softwerkskammer.org/).

Don't hesitate to contact me, if you need advice, [I'm happy to help](https://twitter.com/coderbyheart/status/940636875794067456).
