[`{"pronoun":"he"}`](http://pronoun.is/he)

As a
[Software Crafter](https://coderbyheart.com/become-a-certified-software-craftsperson/)
I am using my 20+ years of experience working as a software developer,
consultant, coach, mentor, and founder to build cloud-based solutions for the
Internet of Things using JavaScript at
[Nordic Semiconductor](https://www.nordicsemi.com/).

I am [@coderbyheart](https://twitter.com/coderbyheart) on Twitter, you can
follow me there for my daily ramblings about the challenges of writing software.

> I live in Trondheim, Norway 🇳🇴 and share photos about my camping adventures

My professional career has been greatly influenced by taking an active role in
communities, whether as a participant, contributor, community initiator, or
speaker.

I especially enjoys the diverse and deep discussion of the
[Software Craft Community](https://softwerkskammer.org/).

Don't hesitate to contact me, if you need advice,
[I'm happy to help](https://twitter.com/coderbyheart/status/940636875794067456).

## 👨‍💻 Volunteering

I am a code contributor at [Distribute Aid](https://distributeaid.org) where I
help build the software that helps aid workers across Europe improve the lives
of newcomers.

> We are always looking for new contributors and maintain an up-to-date
> [Getting Started Guide](https://www.notion.so/CONTRIBUTING-4ba5060441e44925b5e22aa674d4729e).

Here are some posts about my work there:

## 🤘 Communities

I'm constantly trying to improve the community I am part of. Since 2012 I've
volunteered and initiated conferences, barcamps, meetups, events and platforms
that support them:

### [Codefreeze](https://codefreeze.fi/)

Since 2017 I am helping to make Codefreeze the
[most amazing software conference in the world](https://coderbyheart.com/codefreeze-brings-the-magic-of-socrates-to-lapland/).
Since 2019 there is also a summer-version:
[Codebreeze](https://codebreeze.netlify.com/).

<details><summary>Show more communities I have initiated or helped to build</summary>
<p>

### BarCamps

**[BarCamp RheinMain](https://barcamp-rheinmain.de)**

From 2013 to 2016 I was in charge of the homepage and ran the registration and
the check-in during the event and developed a custom event management software
which enables participants to complete the check-in within a few seconds.

**[Leancamp Frankfurt](http://www.leancamp.net/frankfurt.html)**

In 2016 I helped to organize two LeanCamp events in Frankfurt.

**[Augenhöhe Camp](http://augenhoehe-camp.de/)**

In 2016 I helped organize the Augenhöhe Camp Frankfurt.

### Meetups

**#techleadsffm**

In 2015 I initated an invite only breakfast club for tech-leads in the RheinMain
area called #techleadsffm. We are currently 20 members and meeting roughly every
month.

**[Webmontag Offenbach](http://wemoof.github.io/www-jekyll/)**

This event was born out of the idea that the digital scene in my hometown
Offenbach needed its own place to connect. From 2013 to 2015 I organized and
hosted 12 events, which were inspired by
[Frankfurt's Webmontag](https://wmfra.de/).

**[Founders table Frankfurt/RheinMain](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Grunderstammtisch-Founders-Table-FrankfurtRheinMain/)**

In 2012 I co-founded the founders table Frankfurt/RheinMain to provide a
continuous meeting point for the start-ups and future founders in our region
which I co-organized until 2013. It's still active and the biggest meetup group
in the region.

**[Webmontag Frankfurt](https://wmfra.de/)**

Once in a while I helped with the check-in at one of Frankfurt's oldest tech
events.

**[Python Usergroup RheinMain](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Python-User-Group-Rhein-Main/)**

I initated the Python Usergroup RheinMain (PyUGRM) in 2012 and organized 7
events until 2013. It is still active until today.

### Events

**[TechWomen Norway](https://techwomen.no/ada-lovelace-day-2019.html)**

In 2019 I helped to organize the _Ada Lovelace mini-conference_ and the
presentation of the 2019 Tech Role Models, which took place in Oslo.

**[RheinMain Tech Cabal](https://github.com/coderbyheart/blog/blob/gh-pages/rheinmain-tech-cabal.md)**

In 2017 I organized and hosted an invite-only event for tech people that aims to
provide a safe space to engage in deep conversations.

**[Gründerboutique](https://twitter.com/grndrbtq)**

In 2013 I co-organized two invite only startup events, where 15 people worked on
startup ideas.

**Startup Weekend RheinMain 2014**

At the second Startup Weekend in the RheinMain region I helped the teams as a
coach and supported them throughout the weekend to create an compelling pitch
for their ideas.

**[TEDx RheinMain](http://hello.tedxrheinmain.de/)**

In 2012 and 2013 I helped organize the TEDxRheinMain. My role included
on-location event registration and general support.

### Platforms

**[#RheinMainRocks](https://t.co/U5I9KmGd27)**

A _hashtag_ where a lot of the activities that happen are shared. I did create
the [@rmrocksco](https://twitter.com/rmrocksco) and build tools which
automatically curate its tweets. I also ran a
[crowd-funding campaing to print stickers](https://coderbyheart.com/rheinmainrocks-sticker/)
which were distributed at events in the region.

**[UGRM](https://github.com/rheinmainrocks/ugrm-data)**

A website that collected information and events of technology usergroups in
RheinMain. The data was managed through pull-requests by the community itself.
The project was discontinued in 2017 since Meetup has become the defacto
standard for usergroups.

### It does not run on my machine: Integration testing a cloud-native application

In this talk I will take you through the challenge of testing a cloud-native
application. I will cover the challenges when developing solutions on top of
serverless components which you cannot run on your own machine and how I
designed a BDD driven approach to run the integration tests.

### Motivating developers with purposeful work

I work at a company where we decide on our own, when how and on what we work; I
have full control over my life. We believe that working in a so-called network
organization, without central leadership, is the only sensible and sustainable
way to run a business. But what does that mean for managers if you no longer can
assign work to your team? New skills are required and in this talk I want to
give a glimpse into the future of tech-leadership and what is need from you to
build a joyful workplace for team.

### TDD vs. Velocity: Testing for start-ups and other organizations with fast innovation cycles

These days, when every new project is a start-up, we need to run software that
is both robust (because there are customers already using it) and open for
change (because we are constantly adding new features). This provides a
challenge for applying TDD.

### There is no half-remote team

Having remotes on the team enables you to hire for talent and not for
availability. From my recent positions I learned that it is critical to encode
remote work in every team members work habits-even if they are working on
location. This talk highlights the issues that arise when teams or not
co-located and how to deal with them.
